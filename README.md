# Pocahontas - AI Based Air Traffic Control System


# Pocahontas is designed to be proactive in detecting and preventing collisions. If Pocahontas detects a potential collision, it will use the radio frequency to ping the aircraft with an AI voice saying "alter your course or collision imminent." This will give the pilots enough time to react and avoid the collision.
   
Pocahontas is also designed to be a redundant system, meaning that it will have multiple backup systems in place in case of failure. This ensures that air traffic control can continue to operate even if there is a problem with one of the systems.   
  
## Here is an example of how Pocahontas might work to prevent a collision:  

Pocahontas detects two aircraft that are on a collision course.   
Pocahontas pings both aircraft with an AI voice saying "alter your course or collision imminent."   
The pilots of both aircraft react to the warning and alter their courses.   
The collision is avoided.   
Pocahontas is still under development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way air traffic is controlled. By being redundant and proactive, Pocahontas could help to prevent collisions and improve the safety of air travel.
